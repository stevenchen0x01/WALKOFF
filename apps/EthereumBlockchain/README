The Ethereum Blockchain App has only been tested on Ubuntu.

To install the dependencies run:
  ./installDependencies.sh
  Note: Geth and NodeJS will be installed to the $HOME path

After you installed the dependencies, run the function:
  set_up_network (See tests/testMain.py)

By default, if no argument is provided, then the set_up_network() creates an
Ethereum network with 2 server nodes.

Note that running the set_up_network() script will empty out the following
directories:
  1. dd # Temporary data directories and supplementary files for setting up nodes
  2. keystore # Store nodes' keys

See 'dd/logs' for logs, and run e.g. 'geth attach dd/dd1/geth.ipc' to use CLI for 1st node.
Note that mining occurs, so the logs are continuously being updated in the background.
